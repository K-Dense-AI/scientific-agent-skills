# How-To / Tutorial Guide Template

> **Back to [Markdown Style Guide](../references/markdown_style_guide.md)** — Read the style guide first for formatting, citation, and emoji rules.

**Use this template for:** Step-by-step tutorials, how-to guides, onboarding walkthroughs, runbooks, setup instructions, or any document whose primary job is teaching someone to do something. Designed so the reader succeeds on the first attempt.

**Key features:** Prerequisites with verification commands, numbered steps with expected output at each stage, "verify it works" checkpoints, troubleshooting section for common failures, and "what's next" pathways.

**Philosophy:** A how-to guide fails if the reader gets stuck. Every step should be verifiable — the reader should be able to confirm they did it right before moving to the next one. Anticipate the exact moment they'll wonder "did that work?" and put a checkpoint there. Include the error messages they'll actually see, not just the happy path.

---

## How to Use

1. Copy this file to your project
2. Replace all `[bracketed placeholders]` with your content
3. **Test the guide yourself from scratch** — follow every step on a clean machine. If you skip this, the guide has bugs.
4. Add [Mermaid diagrams](../references/mermaid_style_guide.md) for process overviews, decision points, or architecture context
5. Include actual output (trimmed) at every verification step — don't just say "you should see output"

---

## The Template

Everything below the line is the template. Copy from here; commands, API routes,
versions, thresholds, and numerical values are illustrative placeholders. Verify them
against the actual project before publishing. Follow its existing tracker and PR conventions.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

| Requirement      | Version     | Verify with           | Install link                         |
| ---------------- | ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| [Tool/Runtime]   | ≥ [version] | `[command] --version` | [Install guide](https://example.com) |
| [Dependency]     | ≥ [version] | `[command] --version` | [Install guide](https://example.com) |
| [Account/Access] | —           | [How to verify]       | [Sign up](https://example.com)       |

**Verify all prerequisites:**

```bash
# Run each command — all should succeed before proceeding
[command1] --version    # Expected: [version] or higher
[command2] --version    # Expected: [version] or higher
```

> ⚠️ **Don't skip this.** Step 3 will fail if [specific prerequisite] isn't installed correctly.

## 🔧 Steps

### Step 1: [Action verb — Set up / Create / Configure / Install]

[Brief context: why this step is necessary — one sentence.]

```bash
[command to run]
```

**Expected output:**

```
[What the terminal should show — include actual output, trimmed if long]
```

> 💡 **Tip:** [Helpful context about this step — common variation, what to do if on a different OS, etc.]

---

### Step 2: [Action verb]

[Brief context.]

```bash
[command to run]
```

**Expected output:**

```
[What you should see]
```

**If you see an error here**, check:

- [Most common cause and fix]
- [Second most common cause and fix]

---

### Step 3: [Action verb]

[Brief context.]

[If this step involves editing a file, show the exact content:]

```yaml
# config/[filename]
[key]: [value]
[key]: [value]

# [Comment explaining what this section does]
[key]:
  [nested_key]: [value]
  [nested_key]: [value]
```

> 📌 **Important:** [Critical detail about this configuration — what breaks if you get it wrong]

| --------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| [Check 1] | `[command]` | [What success looks like] |
| [Check 2] | `[command]` | [What success looks like] |
| [Check 3] | `[command]` | [What success looks like] |

**All checks pass?** You're done. Jump to [What's next](#-whats-next).

**Something failed?** See [Troubleshooting](#-troubleshooting) below.
